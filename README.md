# AI-Self-Driving-Car
This code is a self-driving car simulator using reinforcement learning, with a graphical user interface to interact with the car and environment. The AI is trained to navigate a map while avoiding obstacles (represented by sand). The code uses a neural network (Q-network) to make decisions about the car's actions.
